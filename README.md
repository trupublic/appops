# AppOps

A simple services framework to make Java services development and integration from TypeScript clients super easy. 

It allows you to 

> implement your web services as normal Java interface / class combination

> auto generate matching typescript interfaces that are directly usable on client without any custom plumbing need

> pass and retreive your json objects to and from your services.
